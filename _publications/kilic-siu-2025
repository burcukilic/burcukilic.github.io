Intelligent agents sense and act in a continuous space at the sensorimotor level. However, most of our daily tasks require manipulating a finite number of objects using a fixed set of skills, suggesting the use of perceptual and action primitives. Previous studies either learn perceptual primitives from a set of high-level actions or learn these actions from hand-coded states. In this study, we propose a neural architecture that allows simultaneous learning of action primitives together with object-level perceptual primitives from interaction data. The interaction process is guided by an active learning module that enables the search for effect-focused action parameters. The experiment results show that our model can find meaningful action primitives.
