Burcu Kılıç
======

Hi! I am a senior Computer Engineering student at Bogazici University (graduating January 2026) in Istanbul, Türkiye, specializing in neuro-symbolic AI, intrinsic motivation, and developmental robotics. My research focuses on building agents that acquire symbolic action and perception abstractions autonomously—closing the gap between continuous sensorimotor signals and high-level reasoning.

I am currently an undergraduate research assistant in the CoLoRs (Cognition, Learning and Robotics) Lab in Bogazici University, advised by Assoc. Prof. Emre Ugur, where I work on discovering symbolic skills from interaction data using curiosity-driven learning and deep predictive models.  

Beyond robotics, I have experience in vision-based generative modeling, LLM-based applications, RAG pipelines, and transformer-based policy learning (Decision Transformers), gained through internships in industry and research groups across Germany, Austria, Sweden, and Türkiye (more detailed in my CV).
