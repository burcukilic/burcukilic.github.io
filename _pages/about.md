Burcu Kılıç
======

Hi! I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at Bogazici University in Istanbul, Türkiye with an expected graduation date of January 2026. I am highly interested in neuro-symbolic AI and learning with intrinsic motivation. In my future studies I want to work on systems that replicate human learning and development.

Currently I am an undergraduate research assistant in CoLoRs (Cognition, Learning and Robotics) Lab in Bogazici University, where I work on neuro-symbolic AI in robotics with Prof. Emre Uğur.
